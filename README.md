# conservation_mode_L5P
This is a simple script for Lenovo Legion 5 pro, that enables the conservation mode feature to work in Linux, as there is no availability of Lenovo Vantage software in Linux. This is fully tested for Ubuntu and will work on the other debian distributions.

#####
The installation procedure is very simple

1. Download both the conservation_mode.py and init.sh files and KEEP BOTH THE FILES IN THE SAME FOLDER ALWAYS.
2. Once done, open your terminal from the folder which has both the files

$ bash init.sh

3. From then onwards, to run the tool perform, 

$ conservation mode

Thankl you :)
